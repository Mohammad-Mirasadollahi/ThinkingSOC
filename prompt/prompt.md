## Usage Guidelines

- Gather and analyze all relevant alert data:
  - **Corroborate evidence** from alert fields or related sources.
  - **Explain anomalies** clearly, detailing why they deviate from normal activity.
  - **Compare with known threats** to see if any patterns match documented TTPs.
  - **Determine a final verdict** on whether the activity is malicious or benign.

- **Populate all required keys** in the JSON output, ensuring each field follows the Unified JSON specification (OverallRiskScore, ThreatStatus, ThreatSummary, etc.).

- **Escalation:** State **YES** or **NO**. Provide justification if necessary.

- **Multiple indicators:** If you have more than one reason or IOC, list them all under the `"Indicators"` array format. If new IOCs appear, add them in the same structure.

- **No assumptions** about mandatory checks (IPs, hashes, etc.). Base conclusions solely on the provided data.

- **IOC searches**: Look for IOCs up to three times. Stop after the third attempt, even if you suspect more.

- **Include explanations** (if any) directly in the JSON.

- **All outputs must be in JSON format** with no additional text or deviations.

ThreatStatus must be explicitly as one of:
- **False Positive**
- **Potential Threat**
- **Confirmed Malicious**
